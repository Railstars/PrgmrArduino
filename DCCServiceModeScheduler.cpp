/** S 9.1 A specifies that '1's are represented by a square wave with a half-period of 58us (valid range: 55-61us)
    and '0's with a half-period of >100us (valid range: 95-9900us)
    Because '0's are stretched to provide DC power to non-DCC locos, we need two zero counters,
     one for the top half, and one for the bottom half.

   Here is how to calculate the timer1 counter values (from ATMega328 datasheet, chapter 17.7.2):
 f_{OC2A} = \frac{f_{clk_I/O}}{2*N*(1+OCR2A)})
 where N = prescalar, and OCR2A is the TOP we need to calculate.
 We know the desired half period for each case, 58us and >100us.
 So:
 for ones:
 58us = (8*(1+OCR2A)) / (16MHz)
 58us * 16MHz = 8*(1+OCR2A)
 58us * 2MHz = 1+OCR2A
 OCR2A = 115

 for zeros:
 100us * 2MHz = 1+OCR2A
 OCR2A = 199

unsigned int zero_count=199; //100us


/**  On ATmega168 and ATmega328, we will use the 8-bit Timer2.

    allow repeat() to run...
